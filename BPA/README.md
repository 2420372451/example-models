# Bayesian Population Analysis using WinBUGS

Models from the book "Bayesian Population Analysis using WinBUGS --- A Hierarchical Perspective" (2012) by Marc Kéry and Michaael Schaub.

Origical BUGS code and data files are available at [the website of the book](http://www.vogelwarte.ch/de/projekte/publikationen/bpa/complete-code-and-data-files-of-the-book.html)
