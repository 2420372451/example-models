# Bayesian Cognitive Modeling

Models from the book Bayesian Cognitive Modeling: A Practical Course (2014) by Michael Lee and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers.

Original JAGS and WinBUGS models are available here: http://bayesmodels.com/ 
On the same address you can also find the first two parts of the book and answers to the excercises. 

Stan translation of the models was done by Martin Smira (smira.martin@gmail.com).

### NOTES 

1. All models are prepared for running from R using rstan. Model codes are included in R scripts.

2. Here you can find all models for the first two parts of the book, more models will be published here soon. If you can't wait for the other models, contact me via the email address above.

3. There is a chance that you'll find a mistake in the models, please let me know if you do. Also contact me if you have suggestions to improve the code, but keep in mind that we want to keep readability of the code high. However, please ignore the style inconsistency in the R plotting code. 

4. In the models from the first chapters, you will find notes concerning Stan related differences in model implementation. It is also advised to read chapter "Stan for Users of BUGS" in Stan manual.
