# Bayesian Cognitive Modeling

Models from the book Bayesian Cognitive Modeling: A Practical Course (2014) by 
Michael Lee and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers.

Original JAGS and WinBUGS models are available here: http://bayesmodels.com/ 
On the same address you can also find first two parts of the book and answers  
to the excercises. 

Stan translation of the models was done by Martin Smira (smira.martin@gmail.com).

## NOTES 

1. All models are prepared for running from R using rstan. Model codes are included
in R scripts.

2. Here you can find all models for the first two parts of the book and more models
will be published here soon. If you can't wait for further models, contact me 
on the email address given above.

3 .There is moderate chance that you'll find a mistake in the models, please let me
know if you do. Also contact me if you have suggestions to improve the code, but 
keep in mind that we want to keep readability of the code high. But ignore the 
style inconsistency in the R plotting code please. 

4. In the scripts for models from the first chapters you can find notes to the Stan
specific model implementation. In the later chapter I expect that you read it 
already so try to look in earlier models if you don't understand something. It is
advised to read chapter "Stan for Users of BUGS" in Stan manual first.
